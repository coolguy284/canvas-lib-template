features:
offscreenvanvas canvas mode if div explicitly set to null (not missing)
settingsmanager
  if validatebool is in context of constructor or set function call, validator error is not caught, pass through, otherwise (set input element), catch, assume fail, and log error
  filling out settings div with true settings
  functionality to settings div
    queue up variable updates to div components until settings div is shown again
  persistence
    value loading
    value saving
  if error when updating property / validating, auto revert setting to old value but log error
  if error when calling visibility, assume true but log error
  check that each line of setting info.txt has implementation
stylesheets for full screen template including provisions for settings button / div using classes
add subpixel scale to settings test
move fps and subpixel scale from settings example to separate function
jsdoc everything in canvas-lib
clear all TODOs in codebase
canvasmanager: proper line nums for shader error
canvasmanager: log shader warns by default unless suppresswarnings or suppress a specific warning
version constant exported from version file in misc

low prio:
validate that multiline text input does not contain \r, or maybe silently convert to \n
canvasmanager: screenshot functionality
  pass in canvasmanager to setup, render, teardown to facilitate modular screenshots
  save canvas as png, or render a larger version as png
    helper function to add this to settings as well
fullscreen option
  helper function to add this to settings as well
support for more advanced webgl mode that can pass shaders into texture variables and render to framebuffers
camera scrolling / moving lib that is a pure class that can take in functions for x and y scaling factor based on current x and y
canvasmanager: canvasMgr modularization (for screenshotting and other possible future uses)
  pass in manager object to all trigger funcs for modularization
  add custom user variables object that should be used for modularizability
canvasmanager: ensure default shutdown and error based shutdowns are clean
canvasmanager: finish revising lock
  rename editlock to modelock
  allow lock to be acquired many times, add function for exclusiveAcquire that requires no use of lock at time of acquire, but normal acquires still function after
canvasmanager: wait proper delay with settimeout mode on canvas, subtract the time already elapsed during render; track frametime/rate?
canvasmanager: configurable render onerror behavior
  either immediate shutdown or log and keep going
canvasmanager:
  uvec2 for screen resolution uniform and texture resolution uniforms
canvasmanager: introspection
  function to get all uniforms?
  function to get code of shader?
settingsmanager: await on validator and await on visibility functions

don't care:
canvasmanager: type check value field of CanvasManager.setUniform
canvasmanager: rename frameskips to renderskips
explain that "uniform" means passing value to shader in parens on index page
